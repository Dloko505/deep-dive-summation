# Summation

## Purpose

This project is being built as a base for my [*Reverse Polish Notation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) (RPN) calculator. So, far only initial tasks have been completed.

This will eventually support the following post-fix operators:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Exponentiation
* Modular Division

Development will continue as follows:

1. Read input from command line (complete).
2. Distinguish operands and operators(complete).
3. Implement stack interpreter(partially complete).
